## 2. What is ConnectKit?

**ConnectKit** is a cross-platform Flutter plugin that unifies access to health and fitness data from **Apple HealthKit** (iOS) and **Google Health Connect** (Android).

It simplifies complex native integrations behind a clean, type-safe Dart API ‚Äî helping you focus on your app experience, not platform differences.

## 3. Core Features

üì∂ **Extensive Health Metric Coverage** - Supports a wide and growing variety of common and specialized data types, including workout, sleep, nutrition, biometrics, and characteristics types.

üîó **Unified Platform API** - Combines all core operations‚Äîpermission management, data reading, writing, and deletion‚Äîinto a single, intuitive interface.

üîÄ **Platform-Agnostic Data Schema** - Provides a single, unified Dart data model for all health metrics, completely abstracting the disparate HealthKit and Health Connect platform schemas.

üõ°Ô∏è **Robust and Maintainable Core** - Built on a modern, layered architecture with comprehensive test coverage, guaranteeing stability and contribution clarity for long-term project viability.

‚ö° **Optimized Architecture** - Engineered for speed and resource efficiency, this architecture features minimal runtime overhead, ensuring rapid data processing in production applications.

## 4. Installation

Add `connect_kit` to your Flutter project:

```bash
flutter pub add connect_kit
```

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Platform Setup Required:**
> **iOS** requires HealthKit entitlements and Info.plist permissions.

>
> See our [Platform Setup Guide](doc/Platform_Setup.md) for full details.

## 5. Quick Usage

Here‚Äôs a simple example to get started:

```dart
import 'package:connect_kit/connect_kit.dart';

void main() async {
  // Get the singleton instance
  final connectKit = ConnectKit.instance;

  // Request read permissions for step count
  await connectKit.requestPermissions(readTypes: [CKTypes.steps]);

  // Retrieve step data
  final steps = await connectKit.read(
    types: [CKTypes.steps],
    from: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 1)),
    to: DateTime.now(),
  );

  // Use the data
  print('Total steps: ${steps.length}');
}
```

That‚Äôs all you need to start reading health data from both, iOS and Android, platforms.
