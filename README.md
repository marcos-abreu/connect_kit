## 2. What is ConnectKit?

**ConnectKit** is a cross-platform Flutter plugin that unifies access to health and fitness data from **Apple HealthKit** (iOS) and **Google Health Connect** (Android).

It simplifies complex native integrations behind a clean, type-safe Dart API ‚Äî helping you focus on your app experience, not platform differences.

**Why developers love ConnectKit:**
- üß© **Unified API:** One consistent interface for both platforms.
- ‚ö° **Optimized for health data:** Minimal native overhead, maximum Dart logic.
- ‚ö° **Performance-first architecture:** Built for speed with minimal platform overhead.
- üîí **Privacy-aware:** Respects each platform‚Äôs permission and security model.

## 5. Quick Usage

Here‚Äôs a simple example to get started:

```dart
import 'package:connect_kit/connect_kit.dart';

void main() async {
  // Get the singleton instance
  final connectKit = ConnectKit.instance;

  // Request read permissions for step count
  await connectKit.requestPermissions(readTypes: [CKTypes.steps]);

  // Retrieve step data
  final steps = await connectKit.read(
    types: [CKTypes.steps],
    from: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 1)),
    to: DateTime.now(),
  );

  // Use the data
  print('Total steps: ${steps.length}');
}
```

That‚Äôs all you need to start reading health data from both, iOS and Android, platforms.
